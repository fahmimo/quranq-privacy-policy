  <h1>Privacy Policy for QuranQ</h1>
  <p class="small">Last updated: <span id="d"></span></p>

  <p>
    At <strong>QuranQ</strong>, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our users.
    This Privacy Policy explains what information is handled by the app and how it is used.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
    QuranQ does not require users to create an account. We do not collect personal identification
    information such as name or email address directly.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Usage Data</strong><br>
    The app may store limited data locally on your device, such as quiz progress and prayer history,
    to support app functionality. This data is not transmitted to our servers.

    is processed locally on your device and is not stored or shared with external servers.
